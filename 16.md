# Challenge #16: ❌ Friday deployment

<small>Easy</small>

Yesterday, someone did a _production deployment_ and the application for assembling Christmas trees broke. We've been asked to fix it as soon as possible.

The problem is that the format of the trees has changed. **It's an array of numbers**… **but it should be an object!** For example, the tree: [3, 1, 0, 8, 12, null, 1] looks like this:

```text
//        3
//      /   \
//     1     0
//    / \     \
//   8  12     1
```

What we need is to transform the array into an object where each _node_ of the tree has _value_, _left_, and _right_ properties.

For example, running your _transformTree_ function with _[3, 1, 0, 8, 12, null, 1]_ should return this:

```javascript
{
  value: 3,
  left: {
    value: 1,
    left: {
      value: 8,
      left: null,
      right: null
    },
    right: {
      value: 12,
      left: null,
      right: null
    }
  },
  right: {
    value: 0,
    left: null,
    right: {
      value: 1,
      left: null,
      right: null
    }
  }
}
```

The elf on duty who tried to solve the problem before going home, left us some clues:

- If a node doesn't have a value, it's represented with _null_. Therefore, if a node has a _null_ value, it won't have any children.
- The root node is at index _0_ in the array.
- There's a relationship between the index of a node and the index of its children. Look for the pattern!
