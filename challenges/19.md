# Challenge #19: 💣 Face the sabotage

<small>Medium</small>

Alert at Santa's toy factory! The **Grinch** 😈 has infiltrated the warehouse and sabotaged some of the toys 💣.

**The elves need help to find the sabotaged toys** and remove them before Christmas comes. For this, we have the warehouse map 🗺️, which is a matrix.

The _*_ represent the _sabotaged toys_, and empty cells with a blank space ' ' are _safe places_.

Your task is to write **a function that returns the same matrix but, at each position, shows us the number of sabotaged toys in the adjacent cells**.

If a cell contains a sabotaged toy, it should remain the same. If a cell does not touch any sabotaged toy, it should contain a blank space ' '.

```javascript
const store = [
  ['*', ' ', ' ', ' '],
  [' ', ' ', '*', ' '],
  [' ', ' ', ' ', ' '],
  ['*', ' ', ' ', ' ']
]

console.log(revealSabotage(store))
/* Should display:
[
    ['*', '2', '1', '1'],
    ['1', '2', '*', '1'],
    ['1', '2', '1', '1'],
    ['*', '1', ' ', ' ']
]
*/
```

Keep in mind that…

- Diagonal cells are also considered adjacent.
- The board will always have at least one empty cell ' ' and a sabotaged toy _*_.
- The board can be of any size.
- The numbers are strings.
