# Challenge #22: 🚂 Programming language

<small>Easy</small>

In Santa's toy factory, **the elves are developing a programming language called Santa.js** 👨‍💻👩‍💻 based on symbols to control their toy machines 🚂.

They have created a simple instruction system and need your help to build a **compiler that interprets these symbols**.

The compiler works with a counter that initially has a value of _0_. **The instructions will modify the value of this counter.**

Elves' language instructions based on symbols:

- _+_: Increments the counter value by _1_.
- _*_: Multiplies the counter value by _2_.
- _-_: Subtracts _1_ from the counter value.
- _%_: Mark a return point. Does not modify the counter.
- _<_: Go back **once to the last instruction with the _%_ symbol it has seen**. If there is no previous _%_, it does nothing.
- _¿_: Starts a conditional block that executes if the counter is greater than _0_.
- _?_: Ends a conditional block.

Create a _compile_ function that receives a string with the language instructions and returns the result of executing them. Here are some examples:

```javascript
compile("++*-"); // 3
// (1 + 1) * 2 - 1 = 3

compile("++%++<"); // 6
// 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6

compile("++<--"); // 0
// 1 + 1 - 1 - 1 = 0

compile("++¿+?"); // 3
// 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

compile("--¿+++?"); // -2
// - 1 - 1 = -2
```
