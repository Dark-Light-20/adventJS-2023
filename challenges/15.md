# Challenge #15: ‚ÜîÔ∏è Autonomous robot

<small>Medium</small>

We are programming some **robots** called _giftbot_ ü§ñüéÅ that autonomously navigate gift warehouses.

We are creating a function to which we pass: the _warehouse_ üè¨ they must navigate and the _movements_ ‚ÜîÔ∏è they can make.

The _warehouse_ is represented as an **array of text strings**, where:

- _._ means there is a clear path.
- _*_ means there is an obstacle.
- _!_ is the robot's initial position.

The _movements_ are an **array of text strings**, where:

- _R_ moves the robot one position to the right.
- _L_ moves the robot one position to the left.
- _U_ moves the robot one position upwards.
- _D_ moves the robot one position downwards.

It must be taken into account that **the robot cannot overcome obstacles or the warehouse boundaries.**

Given a warehouse and the movements, we need to return the array with the robot's final position.

```javascript
const store = ['..!....', '...*.*.']

const movements = ['R', 'R', 'D', 'L']
const result = autonomousDrive(store, movements)
console.log(result)
/*
[
  ".......",
  "...*!*."
]
*/

// The last movement is to the left, but it cannot move because there is an obstacle.
```

Keep in mind that the _store_ is **an array that can have a number of rows ranging from 1 to 100**, as we have warehouses of all sizes.

Also note that the robot **might end up in its initial position** if it can't move or if it's going around in circles.
