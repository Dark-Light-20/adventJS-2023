# Challenge #13: ⌚️ Calculating the time

<small>Easy</small>

The elves are preparing for **Christmas Eve** and they need your help to determine if they have enough time or not ⏳.

For this, they give you an array with the duration of each delivery. The format of the duration is _HH:mm:ss_, the deliveries start at _00:00:00_ and the time limit is _07:00:00_.

**Your function must return the time they will lack or the time they will have left over in order** to finish the deliveries. The format of the returned duration should be _HH:mm:ss_.

If they finish before _07:00:00_, the remaining time until _07:00:00_ should be displayed with a negative sign. For example, **if they have 1 hour and 30 minutes left over, return -01:30:00**

```javascript
calculateTime(['00:10:00', '01:00:00', '03:30:00'])
// '-02:20:00'

calculateTime(['02:00:00', '05:00:00', '00:30:00'])
// '00:30:00'

calculateTime([
  '00:45:00',
  '00:45:00',
  '00:00:30',
  '00:00:30'
]) // '-05:29:00'
```
