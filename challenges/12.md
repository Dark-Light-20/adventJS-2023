# Challenge #12: ðŸ“¸ Is it a valid copy?

<small>Medium</small>

At the North Pole, **they still use paper photocopiers**. The elves use them to copy the letters that children send to Santa so they can send them to all the gift departments.

However, **they are very old and donâ€™t work very well**. Every time they make a copy, the quality of the copy slightly decreases, a phenomenon known as _generational loss_.

**You need to detect if one letter is a copy of another**. The letters are very long and you canâ€™t read them, but you can compare them with an algorithm.

Thereâ€™s a big **probability** that a character would degrade in each copy (it doesn't always happen!). And when it does, the rule it follows is:

- The characters from _A_ to _Z_ degrade from uppercase to lowercase (_A-Z_ â‡’ _a-z_)
- Letters degrade in a series of characters in this order: _a-z_ â‡’ _#_ â‡’ _+_ â‡’ _:_ â‡’ _._ â‡’
- Characters that are not letters (like digits) do not degrade.

Knowing this and receiving the original letter and the copy, you must determine if the copy is a copy of the original.

```javascript
checkIsValidCopy(
  'Santa Claus is coming',
  'sa#ta cl#us is comin#'
) // true
checkIsValidCopy(
  'Santa Claus is coming',
  'p#nt: cla#s #s c+min#'
) // false (for the initial p)
checkIsValidCopy('Santa Claus', 's#+:. c:. s') // true
checkIsValidCopy('Santa Claus', 's#+:.#c:. s') // false (there is a # where it should not be)
```

To understand how photocopies work and their degradation, look at this example:

```text
original:  'Santa Claus'
1st copy:  'santa cla#s'
2nd copy:  'sa#t# cl#+s'
3rd copy:  'sa+## c#+:s'
4th copy:  's#++. c+:.s'
5th copy:  's#+:. c:. s'
```

Therefore _s#+:. c+:++_ is a valid copy of _Santa Claus_. And, as you can see, the degradation of the letters does not occur in a specific order, it is random.
